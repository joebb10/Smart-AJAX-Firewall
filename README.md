Current Licenses: Available only by request. Users can request a license by emailing joebn10@proton.me.

## Description

Smart AJAX Firewall is a lightweight cybersecurity plugin for WordPress that secures your website by filtering and optimizing AJAX requests. It helps improve both security and performance by allowing users to whitelist specific AJAX actions and protect against unauthorized or malicious requests.

This plugin is ideal for websites that rely heavily on AJAX functionality, such as eCommerce stores (WooCommerce) or form-heavy sites (Contact Form 7). It provides an additional layer of security while minimizing the impact on site performance.

### Features

- AJAX Firewall: Whitelists safe AJAX actions and filters out malicious or unnecessary ones.
- Select2 UI: User-friendly multi-select interface to choose AJAX actions, with an option to manually add custom actions.
- License Validation: The plugin requires a valid license key, which is validated through an external server.
- Customizable Security: Allows administrators to manage which AJAX actions are allowed to run.
- Performance Optimization: Blocks unneeded AJAX requests to reduce server load and improve site speed.

### How It Works

- License Requirement: The plugin will only work if a valid license key is provided. Licenses are available by request by emailing joebn10@proton.me.
- AJAX Whitelisting: Users can select predefined AJAX actions or add custom actions to the whitelist.
- Enhanced Security: Unauthorized or unwhitelisted AJAX actions are blocked or scanned for potential security threats (like script injections).
